# PoE2 - ENHANCED UI
Document version: 1.0 | Mod version: 0.3.0.001

## Introduction:

This mod changes how afflictions and inspirations will be displayed within the game by colorizing the text. The mod also adds a rank indicator to afflictions and inspirations so that the player more easily can identify what buffs/debuffs to prioritize while playing.

The goal of this mod is to enhance the user experience and make a fairly opaque part of the game more transparent.

This mod does not change the way spells and abilities work.
